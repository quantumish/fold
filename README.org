* About
Parallelized lattice protein folding for consumer hardware seeking to quickly model proteins at a low level of detail. Utilizes a single strategy multistart simulated annealing method to find energy minimum in protein landscape in parallel.

* Build
To build both the binary and the python library, follow the steps below (replace "75" with the compute capability of your GPU if necessary).
#+begin_src sh
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES='75' ..
  make
#+end_src

* Usage
Run =python vis.py= for a demo of the =fold= library.
